# Hi, I'm Curtis

I am currently a __Full stack Developer__ at [__Two Three Bird__](https://github.com/twothreebird).

A little bit about me:
```txt
- I'm a Laravel & Docker fanboy (if I must say so myself 😆)
- I strongly dislike Wordpress (just no ok? 🙅‍♂️)
- AWS is where the party is at (whoop whoop 🎉🎉)
- Working from Home saves everybody ⌚ & 💵
```

If you feel like reaching out, get me on ![LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/curtis-page-a63a7b74) or ...
maybe you wanna do it the good old-fashioned way?
